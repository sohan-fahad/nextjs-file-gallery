This is a document upload and editing application built with Tailwind, TypeScript, and React.js. It allows users to upload PDF files, add elements (text and/or images) to specific positions within the document, view the edited document, and even dictate the position (coordinates) for element placement. Plus, we've added a sprinkle of humor to make your experience enjoyable!
